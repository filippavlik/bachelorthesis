## **Bachelor thesis**
 - system for administration of the delegations for the Prague Football Association (**PFS**)

## Description
> PFS hosts **+-350** matches a week throughout Prague, it is difficult to delegate and coordinate all **250** possible active referees

- Current situation

  delegating people takes place using various excel tables , those are: 

  1. **List of referees and their levels**. It determines which referee is at which level, which competition he referees primarily.[Nomination_paper](materials_used_by_pfs/Nomination_paper.xlsx) -_partially formatted_- 
  2. **Table of reported excuses on given game days** .     Individual referees send every week eventual excuses to the association mail, those excuses in mails are manually overwritten to this file.In this file are also included informations about residence and veto from clubs  - [Excuses](materials_used_by_pfs/Excuses.xlsx) -_totally unformatted_
  3. **List of matches for future week**. This file is every week downloaded from registrace.fotbal.cz site, the privileged access must be assigned. - [List_matches](
materials_used_by_pfs/List_matches.xls) -_totally formatted_ 
  4. **Document r/team home/team away**. Where is recorded how many times the person has refereed to the given team at home and away. -_the state unknown_

**Procces of delegation-**
the whole process of putting together a delegation can be divided into phases, it is done for a week 2 weeks in advance - 
1a. preparation before each weekend, list of which referee whistled which team the previous weekend - manually
1b. collecting and rewriting excuses from the association's email into an Excel document - manually 
2. combining matches that take place immediately after each other on the same/closely located pitches - manually
3. delegation itself,
the matches are extracted from the list List_matches.xls, the matches are filled with priority from the highest and are entered by individual referees in the Excuses document, where apologies and vetoes from the clubs are already taken into account, we also have to take into account how many times the referee was on the team from the table...

- Planned features and status 


    So in summary this system should make this work        easier and more transparent for them.


## Usage
> now the persons responsible for the administration and scheduling of matches spend a total of up to **50** hours a week.

The purpose of use is deployment in real proccess of administration, potentially, if possible, expansion among other football organizations.
